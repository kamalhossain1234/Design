            <p>A portfolio is a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash
                equivalents, including closed-end funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). People generally believe that
                stocks, bonds, and cash comprise the core of a portfolio. Though this is often the case, it does not
                need to be the rule. A portfolio may contain a wide range of assets including real estate, art, and
                private investments.</p>
